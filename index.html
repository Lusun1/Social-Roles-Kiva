            <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
            <p>This task is to name a group of users in an onling platform "Kiva.org". Kiva.org is a non-profit peer-to-peer lending platform that allows people to lend money via the Internet to low-income entrepreneurs and students all over the world. Kiva had lending teams, through which lenders who have something in common(eg: interests, occupations, religious) can band together and try to convince each other to contribute loans. Lenders could join in the team discussion to convince other members to lend and communicate with others, which is similar as the facebook group. For example: one people recommended to other members loans by sending the message: "Please consider this loan. His time will soon run out. http://www.kiva.org/lend/524358".<br>
            The goal of this task to provide the name of a group of team members. For example, we could name the user who always introduce different loans to team members, as 'persuader'; we could name the user who always talk to different people as 'communicator'. In this study, we will provide some description of a group of users and some texts which these group members said in the team discussion. Your task is to use several key words to describe these roles based on these descriptions and their messages. Please use the description as the main basis when you name the group of users because it is the common description for the whole group members, and then use the text just for evaluation.
            </p><br>
            <p><strong>Here is a practice question:</strong></p>
            <p>This group of users mentioned more words to describe the scarcity of the loans than others. For example, they used the word "left" to emphasize how many hours were remaining in the requests. These scarcity words included: "left", "remaining", and "expire". They also donated more loans in the name of this team compared with other teams. They used fewer words, such as "can", "could", "may", "might", "must", "will", "would", "should", than other people, to indicate likelihood, request, suggestions, order and obligation.<br>       User sample 1 - "John" in the "new york" group:</strong><br> 
              John donated many loans in Kiva. He gave half of his loans in the name of his team ‘new york’, and he gave other loans in the name of other teams and himself. In his lending, he gave more attention to his team “new york” than others.<br> 
          1. "Just mad a loan to Alterick in GA. His loan expires in 20 hours. I'm new to the group so I don't know how to post the link to his loan but he is top of the list in USA. " <br> 
          2. "Please consider this loan. His time will soon run out. http://www.kiva.org/lend/524358"</p>
              <label>You need to select reasonable names to describe this group users. Select all that apply. </label>
              <div>
                <input type="checkbox" name="persuaders" value="persuaders"> They are persuaders, since they used the scarcity words to show the emergency of loans and they also contribute the team by lending.<br>
                <input type="checkbox" name="encouragers" value="encouragers"> They are encouragers, since they used the scarcity words to show the emergency of loans and they also contribute the team by lending.<br>
                <input type="checkbox" name="encouragers" value="encouragers"> They are supporter, since they used the scarcity words to show the emergency of loans and they also contribute the team by lending.<br>
                <input type="checkbox" name="encouragers" value="encouragers"> They are aggressor.<br>

              <p>This task is to generate words that accurately summarizes the behavior of a group of users who seem to play a similar role in the online platform<a href="https://www.kiva.org/">"Kiva.org"</a>. You are going to use at least three keywords and phrases to describe these roles based on these descriptions and messages.  If you would like to know more about the instruction and how we describe these members, please check <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lus1/project/kiva/intro.html">here</a>. In this task, please use the description as the main basis when you name the group of users because it is the common description for the whole group members, and then use the text just to evaluate your answer.<br>

              <p><strong>Please read the user description below:</strong></p>
              <p>This group of users sent more messages to greet and welcome other group members, than the average. For example, they used the word "welcome" to greet with newcomers. Also, they were more likely to use the word "we" to show their belonging to the team, than the average. In addition, they used more positive words, such as "great", "good", "nice" than others, in order to express their positive feelings and objectives in the discussion. Moreover, they used more words, such as "can", "could", "may", "might", "must", "will", "would", "should", than other people, to indicate likelihood, request, suggestions, order and obligation. They were more likely to mention "goals" and talk about team achievement than the average. In their posts, they sent fewer links of loans. Users could get to the loan's page by clicking on these links of loans.</p>

        <strong>Message 2</strong>: &quot;@Jan re: I couldn't agree more.  One of the main advantages of Kiva is the ability to direct money to women's groups.  A strategy such as this is long overdue particularly if combined with better educationally opportunities for women and girls. Men control most of the world's resources and a more balanced approach is needed. Best wishes to everyone in the Freethinkers funding team.&quot;<br />

They are active engagers who are talktive and send long, detailed messages to persuader others to lend, provide detailed information about loans or coordinate others team members. They keep open and positive attitude in the team discussion.</div>
